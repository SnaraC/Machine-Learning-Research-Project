# Machine learning-based predictive modeling of depression in hypertensive populations

The "Dataset_basic" comprises essential patient information, depression-related data, and details on inflammatory proteins.

The dataset is private and not available for public access. 

The research employs three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-layer perceptron neural network.

As a result, Support Vector Machine emerges as the top-performing model among the three, showcasing the highest accuracy and F1 score of above 90%. Comparatively, the Multi-layer Perceptron neural network exhibited slightly inferior performance, achieving an accuracy of about 75% or lower. Logistic Regression results in between 75% to 80% of accuracy and F1 score.
